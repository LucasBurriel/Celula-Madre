Also, at points of the game, you might say, is this game worth $50.00? Well, its worth about $30.00. 1.- Its not a good game for portability. 2.- Lighting is bad at times 3.-Can be hard for beginners. So I suggest that you must know what the first few NBA Street games are about before buying thsi title. PS:Its a fun game after a while",
