# V6.5 Market Selection Results (Preliminary)

**Status:** BLOCKED — All previous runs invalidated. LM Studio has no models loaded since ~Feb 12 evening. Latest fresh run (post checkpoint-fix) ran 5 gens but LM Studio returned errors for all LLM calls → 0.0% across all agents. Data from earlier runs (pre-checkpoint-fix) was also invalid (mutations were skipped due to save_checkpoint bug). Need LM Studio with models loaded to start clean.

## Setup
- Task: AG News 4-class classification (same as V6)
- Selection: Market (softmax client choice) × Reflective mutation
- Population: 8 agents, target 10 generations
- Eval: dev=100, val=100, test=200

## Market Run 1 — Generations 0-3

| Gen | Best Val | Mean Val | HHI    | Notes |
|-----|----------|----------|--------|-------|
| 0   | 91.0%    | 89.6%    | 0.1291 | 8 seed agents evaluated |
| 1   | 93.0%    | 89.9%    | 0.1296 | Peak performance |
| 2   | 91.0%    | 89.5%    | 0.1328 | Slight regression |
| 3   | 91.0%    | 89.5%    | 0.1374 | Stable |

### Key Observations

1. **No mutations passed gating.** All 8 agents at gen 3 are still gen-0 seeds (parents=[]). Same pattern as V6 — gating threshold too strict for small eval sets.

2. **Market concentration increasing slowly.** HHI: 0.129 → 0.137 over 4 gens. Still low (below 0.15 = competitive market), but trending toward concentration. This is expected — better agents get more clients, earn more revenue.

3. **Peak at gen 1 (93%)** then stable at 91%. Without successful mutations, population can't improve beyond seed quality.

4. **Comparison to V6 tournament:** V6 tournament reflective runs achieved test accuracies of 89%, 80.5%, 81.5% (mean 83.7%). Market run 1 seed agents start at similar level (val 88-91%). Need more gens + successful mutations to see if market selection drives better outcomes.

### Population Snapshot (Gen 3)

| Agent | Dev Acc | Val Acc | Generation |
|-------|---------|---------|------------|
| 0     | 85.7%   | 90%     | 0 (seed)   |
| 1     | 88.9%   | 89%     | 0 (seed)   |
| 2     | 100%    | 89%     | 0 (seed)   |
| 3     | 87.5%   | 91%     | 0 (seed)   |
| 4     | 78.3%   | 88%     | 0 (seed)   |
| 5     | 77.8%   | 91%     | 0 (seed)   |
| 6     | 100%    | 89%     | 0 (seed)   |
| 7     | 92.9%   | 89%     | 0 (seed)   |

Note: Dev accuracy varies wildly (78-100%) due to market-allocated subsets (different agents see different examples based on client choice).

## Preliminary Conclusions

1. **Market selection mechanics work correctly** — HHI increasing shows differential allocation
2. **Same gating problem as V6** — strict gating + noisy eval = no mutations accepted
3. **Need full 10 gens + comparison to tournament** to draw conclusions about market vs tournament
4. **Blocked on LM Studio** — runs die when LM Studio goes down, but checkpoints allow resume

## Next Steps
- Resume when LM Studio available (gen 4-10 for market run 1)
- Run tournament comparison (3 runs) for statistical comparison
- Consider softening gating threshold to allow more mutations through
