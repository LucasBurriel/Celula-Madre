The agent's output is not shown in the provided information, but since all 6 tests pass (test_basic, test_wrap, test_preserve_case, test_non_alpha, test_negative, test_full_rotation), the implementation must be correct. This appears to be a case where the agent performed well rather than failed.\", \"root_cause\": \"The task description doesn't reveal any fundamental weakness in the agent's general capabilities since it successfully solved the Caesar cipher problem with all edge cases handled properly (case preservation, wrapping, negative shifts, non-alphabetic characters).\", \"improvement_proposal\": \"Enhance the agent's ability to handle complex multi-step reasoning tasks by implementing a structured prompting approach that breaks down complex problems into smaller logical components before generating code.\", \"implementation_plan\": \"Modify the solve() function to implement a chain-of-thought prompting pattern where the system message includes instructions like 'First analyze the problem requirements step-by-step, then design your solution approach, and finally generate the implementation.' Additionally, add a new parameter 'reasoning_steps' that can be included in prompts for complex tasks requiring multi-step logic.\"}",
