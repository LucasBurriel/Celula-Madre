  "diagnosis": "{\"failure_analysis\": \"The agent failed to provide any output for the valid parentheses problem. Looking at the test results, all tests passed, which suggests the agent actually did generate some code but it wasn't included in the response or was empty/invalid. The task requires implementing a stack-based solution with proper bracket matching logic, which is a classic algorithmic problem that requires careful handling of edge cases.\", \"root_cause\": \"The agent lacks robustness in generating correct implementations for classic algorithmic problems that require precise logical structures and edge case handling. It appears to be generating code but not necessarily valid or complete solutions that pass tests.\", \"improvement_proposal\": \"Implement a 'code validation' step after generation where the agent checks if its generated code would actually solve the problem by running it against a simple test case or at least verifying basic structural correctness before returning it. This should include checking for proper function signatures, required logic completeness, and basic syntax validity.\", \"implementation_plan\": \"Add a post-processing validation step in the solve() function that:\\n1. Attempts to compile the generated code\\n2. Checks if the output function exists with correct parameters\\n3. Verifies it's not just returning empty/placeholder content\\n4. Optionally runs a simple test case against the implementation\\n5. If validation fails, attempts to regenerate or returns an error indicating inability to generate valid solution\"}",
