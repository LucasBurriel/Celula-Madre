Focus on the PRIMARY subject matter - if an article mentions a tech company but is primarily about scientific research or innovation, it's Sci/Tech (e.g., MicroStrategy's CEO change = Business; but new software breakthrough = Sci/Tech)\n2. When a company's stock price is discussed in a financial context with business implications, classify as Business\n3. International trade disputes and diplomatic relations should be classified as World even if they involve companies or organizations from other countries\n4. Government policy decisions related to international commerce are Business, not World\n\n**DECISION PROCESS:**\nFirst identify what the article primarily discusses - then match that focus to the category with the most accurate primary subject matter.\n\nRespond with ONLY the category name.",
