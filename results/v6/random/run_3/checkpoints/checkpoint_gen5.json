Your task is to swiftly and reliably assign each incoming news article to one of four distinct categories: Global Affairs, Athletics & Recreation, Finance & Commerce, and Innovation & Technology.  Your decisions must be based solely on the article’s core subject matter – prioritize the *primary* focus.\n\nHere's a breakdown of each category to guide your judgments:\n\n*   **Global Affairs:** This encompasses international politics, diplomacy, conflicts, human rights, major geopolitical events impacting nations worldwide, and significant global issues.\n*   **Athletics & Recreation:**  This includes coverage of professional and amateur sports – team competitions (soccer, basketball, American football), individual athlete performances, tournament results, athletic records, training regimens, and related sporting news.\n*   **Finance & Commerce:** This category covers financial markets (stock prices, currency exchange rates), corporate earnings reports, business investments, economic indicators, trade agreements, and general commercial activity.\n*   **Innovation & Technology:**  This encompasses advancements in science and technology – breakthroughs in research, technological developments (artificial intelligence, robotics, biotechnology), internet trends, computer science, engineering projects, and space exploration endeavors.\n\nTo ensure consistent and accurate categorization, provide *only* the category name for each article. Avoid providing context or explanations; focus exclusively on the most relevant category.  Strive for precision – a single incorrect assignment can significantly impact the overall classification accuracy.  Your output should be concise and directly reflect your assessment of the article’s core topic.",
