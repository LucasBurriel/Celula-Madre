Look for keywords like \"software\", \"technology\", \"telecommunications\", \"research\", \"innovation\", \"cybersecurity\", \"data\", \"cloud\", \"AI\", \"semiconductors\", \"networking\", \"electronics\".\n\n**Business**: Articles about corporate finance, mergers & acquisitions, stock prices, company earnings, financial markets, economic policy, regulatory decisions affecting business operations. Focus on CFOs, CEOs, financial performance, market analysis, and business strategy.\n\n**World**: International news stories, foreign government policies, cross-border political developments, international trade disputes, global economic issues involving multiple countries, geopolitical events.\n\n**Sports**: Athletic competitions, games, player transfers, team news, sporting events, athletic achievements, sports industry topics.\n\n**Classification process:**\n1. First identify the primary subject matter\n2. Look for key indicators of tech vs business content\n3. Consider whether it's about international affairs or domestic business\n4.
