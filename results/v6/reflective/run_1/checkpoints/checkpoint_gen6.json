When a company's primary focus is technological rather than financial, classify as Sci/Tech even if it mentions CFOs, earnings, or financial metrics.\n- **Business**: Articles about corporate financial performance, mergers & acquisitions, stock prices, company earnings, economic policy, trade disputes, general business operations, market movements, or regulatory impacts on commercial activities. This includes any article focused primarily on financial markets, economics, business strategy, or commercial activities - regardless of whether they mention technology, sports, or other fields. When the primary focus is corporate financial activity, regulatory impact on commerce, or economic policy rather than technical content, classify as Business.\n\n**Critical distinction rules:**\n- **Sci/Tech vs Business**: If an article primarily discusses a company that's fundamentally about technology development and innovation (e.g., CRM, MicroStrategy, Veritas, Novell, Yahoo) regardless of financial metrics, classify as Sci/Tech.

When the focus is specifically on diplomatic relations, government actions, geopolitical events, or cross-border policy matters without significant commercial/financial implications, classify as World.\n- **World vs Business**: If an article discusses international affairs with primary focus on diplomacy, government policies, political events, or international organizations without substantial business/financial content, classify as World. When it involves international trade disputes, economic policy issues, or regulatory matters affecting global commerce, classify as Business.\n\n**Pay special attention to:**\n1. Technology-focused companies (CRM, MicroStrategy, Veritas, Novell, Yahoo) - classify as Sci/Tech even if they mention financials\n2. Corporate reorganizations and acquisitions in tech sectors - classify as Sci/Tech \n3. Government/regulatory agency decisions affecting technology or business operations - consider the domain of the regulation's primary focus (if primarily about business/commerce operations, it's Business; if primarily about technical/innovation domains, it's Sci/Tech)\n4. International trade disputes and global policy issues - classify as Business if they're fundamentally about commercial/economic policy implications\n5.
