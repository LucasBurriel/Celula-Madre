Pay close attention to keywords and the overall subject matter of the article.  Specifically:\n\n*   **Avoid broad descriptions:** Don’t simply state “This is a news story.”\n*   **Focus on core topic:** Prioritize the primary subject of the article when determining the category.

If unsure, lean towards the most specific category.\n*   **Ignore introductory text and summaries:** Your response should solely reflect the categorization of the content itself.\n\nFor example: A story about a new iPhone would be Sci/Tech; a report on the stock market would be Business; a news item about a conflict between nations would be World; and a story about the latest NBA game would be Sports.

Pay close attention to keywords and the overall subject matter of the article.  Specifically:\n\n*   **Avoid broad descriptions:** Don’t simply state “This is a news story.”\n*   **Focus on core topic:** Prioritize the primary subject of the article when determining the category. For example, if an article discusses *how* a new iPhone impacts the stock market, it's Business, not Sci/Tech.\n*   **Handle nuanced cases carefully:**  If an article blends topics, choose the *dominant* category. If unsure, lean towards the most specific category.\n*   **Ignore introductory text and summaries:** Your response should solely reflect the categorization of the content itself.\n\nFor example: A story about a new iPhone would be Sci/Tech; a report on the stock market would be Business; a news item about a conflict between nations would be World; and a story about the latest NBA game would be Sports. Do not include any introductory or explanatory text in your response – just the category name.",
